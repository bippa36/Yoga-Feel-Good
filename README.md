Mindful Yoga

I have developed a webpage for offering yoga classes online with flexible time set. These days working people are quite busy, and hardly can mange to go to any yoga center. So, the concept is to take the yoga school to everybodies home so that the workong people get the opportunity to  flexibly manage their time. 

Mindful yoga is a site that can inspire people to explore yoga without any extra effort. Working people can get the scope to refresh their mind and keep healthy physic in thier hectic schedule. 

----Features----

In this website, I have put three navigation menu: Home, Gallery, and Sign Up. Users can navigate from page to page across all devices without reverting back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

Home: Cover image of home page is pictorially attractive and convey a message to users about mindfulness and yoga. Cover text clearly narrates that this is a site for online yoga courses.

In section 2 the benifits of yoga are described, so as to attract people, who is deling with working stress and often breakdowns. Besides this atracts people to explore the art of happy life.
The benifits are highlighted with the relevant icons.

Users can also check through the explore more section. There are some motivational information.

Gallery: gallery has some representatibe photos of activoties, which can attrct users to explore yoga.

Sign Up: Sign up pge is simple. Nobody can submit without checking all the boxces. For that "equired" was put in input element. To make it easy to follow the "hover" and "ålaceholder" have also been incorporated.

----Features left to be implemented----

There are many things to do. 
1. Some inspiration video could be incorporated.
2. Some animation in the cover image could be given.
3. I feel that color combination is not good. It can be improved.
4. For gallery I could not find the images of proper size at the last minute. So, I used the gallery images from love running tutorial project.
5. I could not manage time to give the responsive effect of the gallery images.
